# Claude Artifact Runner - Docker edition

## Overview

Standalone environment that mimics the Claude Artifacts runtime, enabling you to run, test, and further develop the code generated by Claude. You can create a complete web application, comprised of one or more pages, that can be deployed anywhere.

## Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t claude-artifact-runner .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4173:4173 claude-artifact-runner
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:4173/your-artifact-name` (your file's name without the `tsx` extension).

## Running with Docker Compose

To run using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Build and start the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:4173/your-artifact-name` (your file's name without the `tsx` extension).

Every time you change the artifacts source files, you must rebuild and restart the container to see changes.

## Artifacts

The `artifacts/default.tsx` file contains a dummy list. You need to update this file if you want a home page.
