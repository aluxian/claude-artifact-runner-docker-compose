# Claude Artifact Runner Docker Compose

## Overview

This project provides a standalone environment that mimics the Artifacts runtime, enabling you to run, test, and further develop the code generated by Claude, independently from its website. With it, you can create a complete web application, comprised of one or more pages, that can be deployed anywhere, whether locally for your own use, in a company intranet or in a public-facing production environment, at the web hosting or cloud provider of your choice.

## Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t claude-artifact-runner .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4173:4173 claude-artifact-runner
   ```

## Running with Docker Compose

To run the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:4173`.

Every time you change the artifacts source files, you must rebuild the container to see changes.

## Artifacts

The `artifacts/default.tsx` file contains an empty list. You need to update this file if you want a home page style menu.
